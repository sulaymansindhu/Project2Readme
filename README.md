Project 2 Report

When making my website on WordPress , I used several plugins to enhance the quality of my website as well as assisting me by giving suggestions on how to improve my website. The plugins used are listed below.


WordPress Importer

This plugin merely allowed me to import texts, images etc. from online into my website. This was necessary as i used a theme from another website and not the suggested WordPress ones. The theme I used was from www.modernthemes.net. There was no implementation needed to use this plugin, it just had to be installed and activated.

Yoast SEO

This plugin was helpful in giving me suggestions when creating my webiste. When editing my resume page it gave analysis on things such as readability and how to improve. Although this plugin was somewhat helpful, I later used this plugin along with another (RankMath). To use this plugin, I installed and activated it. It then popped up on the side panekl when editing my oages, and gave suggestions and analysis on the content of my pages.

LiteSpeed Cache

I chose this cache plugin as it had many good reviews in boosting site speed while being simple and reliable. I compared reviews with other cahce plugins and found this to be best.

Contact Form

This was another plugin that allowed me to create a contact page on my website. This was also linked to the theme i used from the modernthemes website. This plugin allowed the user to contact me via email through the contact page of the website itself. There was no implementation needed to use this plugin, it just had to be installed and activated.

Elementor

This was a great plugin that made the process of changing and editing pages easier. This was because it used a drag and drop method for adding and removing widgets etc. and had the editing panel side by side with the website preview itself. This meant I could see my edits side by side, making it easier (compared to making edits and then refreshing my website in a new tab each time I wished to get a preview). 

RankMath

This plugin allowed me to analyse and increase the traffic to the website as well as giving suggestions on improving my webiste. I used this in conjuction with the Yoast SEO plugin. After research and reading through reviews, I learnt that this website was pretty good in the features it gave as a SEO plugin.
